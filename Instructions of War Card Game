Instructions:

Each Player will count down. 3...2...1...At this moment, every player will take card off the top of their pile and play it face
up in the middle. The player whose card is the highest gets to collect all the cards from.

If the top cards are the same card the this declares a war! The players the tied must play 2 cards face down and the the final one face up.
The person with the highest card at this point is the winner! Repeat the proccess if the players are tied again!

This same proccess is looped over and over until a player hold all the cards in the deck. That player is then declared the winner!
The players without any cards left are out of the game and cannot return to the game.
