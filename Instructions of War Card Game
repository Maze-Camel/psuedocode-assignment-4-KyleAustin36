Each Player will count down. 3...2...1...At this moment, every player will take card off the top of their pile and play it face
up in the middle. The player whose card is the highest gets to collect all the cards from.

If the top cards are the same card the this declares a war! The players the tied must play 2 cards face down and the the final one face up.
